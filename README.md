# weatherapp

### Create an application that displays the weather forecast  for each day of the week. 

## In your app, aim to include:
* A separate page, tab, or section for each day of the week. This can be done either through using a router (where each page represents a different day - nom install react-router), through different tabs (see http://reactcommunity.org/react-tabs/), or just setting up five containers (could be a simple div) for each day of the forecastable week.  
* Display weather information (high temperature, low temperature) for a given day

## Where do I get the data? 
* Sign up for a free API key from Open Weather Map, fetch a real 5-day forecast, and feed that data into your app.

## What is an API call and how do I make one? 
* Great question! To learn more about what an API is, see: https://medium.freecodecamp.org/what-is-an-api-in-english-please-b880a3214a82
* To learn how to make API calls in react, see: https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-ajax.html
* Chat in slack with questions!! :) 

## Extensions
* Add an image or catchphrase corresponding to the temperature (sun if it’s sunny, or a note saying “it’s freezing” if temperature is low) on a day. 
* Add the ability to click on a day and see its hourly forecast. You can just maintain the current view in the top-level App state.
* Want to get really fancy? Add a graphics library like vx and follow the examples here to add a graph of the temperature over the course of a week or day.

## Reminders on how to get started: 
* Create a new project by running `create-react-app weather-app` in your terminal
* `cd weather-app` into the directory and run `yarn` to build dependencies
* Then run `yarn start` and watch the starter app appear in your browser! 
* To begin editing, look at the app.js file. Start modifying components, etc.
